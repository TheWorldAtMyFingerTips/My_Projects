# Power BI

Similar to the Excel course, the Power BI course was designed to be intensively hands-on (LOVE!). We started off with an updated refresher of how the world has evolved to an information age with an explosion of data volume, the underlying drivers of growth of data science and analytics, how analytics capabilities have evolved and matured, and why visualizations and storytelling are the one of the important keys to everyone's (well, almost ðŸ˜‰) minds. Then immersing ourselves with hands-on learning in Power BI.

Power BI is an application which allows users to get started quickly by unifying data from many sources (cloud and on-premises), using natural language query to build custom visualizations to form real-time dashboards and interactive reports.

This Capstone Project was designed to jog our cognitive process, reinforce and apply our knowledge to "real-life" cases so as to solidify our learnings. We were graded on our ability to showcase and exhibit the five stages of the data lifecycle through the use of Power BI (data collection, creating tables and loading data into Power BI databases, data preparation, data analysis using Power BI, creating visualizations and interactive dashboards, communication of the case study to stakeholders).

# Capstone Project 3: Global Superstore (Retail)

## Abstract
> "A picture is worth a thousand words." - Henrik Ibsen

Likewise for data, good visualizations increase the willingness to read, makes it easier for readers to recognise patterns and find exceptions while interpreting the data at a faster pace to intuitively understand the story of the dataset, and derive inspirations for action.

This project is based off the context that my boss wants an "app-like experience" in PowerBI, with dashboards which not only enable the overview of business, but also inspires actionable insights, with the ultimate objective of driving sales growth.

## Dataset Introduction
The [Global Superstore Dataset](https://data.world/vikas-0731/global-super-store) is a customer-centric dataset, having entries of all orders placed through different locations for the years of 2011 to 2015. It has around 50000 values.

It contains retail metrics such as order_id, order_date, customer_name, segment, category, sub-category, profit, sales, quantity, packaging days, and the like.

## Problem Statement
The Dashboard serves to the perspectives of not only the Global Superstore business, but also the respective Head of Sales people as well. Perspectives of segment, product category, and order dates have also been built into the dashboard for deeper insights.

It serves to answer questions such as:
* Which regions are the top/bottom performers in terms of Net Profits, Net Sales, Net Quantity, number of customers, orders, average discount, return rates.
* What is the trend of sales over the years?
* What is the category mix of sales?
* Which are the top performing products within the categories in terms of quantity, sales, average discount, average retail dollar?
* Who are the top customers?
* Who are the deliquent customers?
* What should we do to improve?

## Process Workflow
My starting point would always be to put myself in the shoes of my target audience (in this case, it's the boss of the Global Superstore and the various Head of Sales) to grasp a solid understanding of the task objective, brainstorm about the questions they need answered, then how I can exploit the dataset to meet the objective(s).

Retail s a very dynamic business which doesn't stop, and it is important to design the dashboards to provide immediate insights of the overall business postition (standing) with actionable angles of the where, when, what, who, why, and hows. I have designed my dashboards following these angles so as to enable cognitive ease and efficiency for the target audience.

Any experienced Power BI user would know that the foundation of Power BI lies in the relationship of the tables (in the model), and that was one of the essential steps that I took - to ensure that built tables are 100% sound and robust. You can see my model's table relationships in the image below:
