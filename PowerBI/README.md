# Power BI

Similar to the Excel course, the Power BI course was designed to be intensively hands-on (LOVE!). We started off with an updated refresher of how the world has evolved to an information age with an explosion of data volume, the underlying drivers of growth of data science and analytics, how analytics capabilities have evolved and matured, and why visualizations and storytelling are the one of the important keys to everyone's (well, almost ðŸ˜‰) minds.

THe following infographic is one of the best (in my humble opinion) infographics which I have come across, to succinctly explain what is an infographic - Data sorted, arranged, and presented visually!
