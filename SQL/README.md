# SQL

### Introduction
Structured Query Language was the fourth core in the curriculum after the modules of Basics of Data Science, Power Query, and Excel. We started off with an introduction to databases, schemas, Entity-Relationship Diagrams, then moved on to SQL datatypes, basic commands, conditional operators, functions and aggregate functions, set operators, joins, and  finished off with stored procedures.

This Capstone Project was designed to ignite our cognitive process, reinforce and apply our knowledge to "real-life" cases so as to solidify our learnings. We were marked on our ability to showcase and exhibit the five stages of the data lifecycle through the use of SQL and Excel (data collection, creating tables and loading data into SQL databases, data preparation, data analysis using SQL, creating Excel interactive dashboard and visualizations, presentation to stakeholders).

### [Capstone Project 2: The Movie Industry, An Overview](https://github.com/TheWorldAtMyFingerTips/My_Projects/blob/main/SQL/Movies.sql)

### Abstract
As like most things in life, there are a plethora of variables as to what makes a movie a "success". This project is based off the angle that my target audience is looking towards going into the movie business and would like to get a overall sense of the movie business.</br></br>

### Dataset Introduction
[The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) consists of 7 csv files (credits, keywords, links, moview_metadata, ratings, etc.). Just the movies_metadata file is too massive to process in excel, and so SQL comes in to save the day!</br></br>

### Problem Statement
**What is the direction I should take in coming up with my debut movie?** Some of the questions answered include:
* How does the trend of released movies look like from an angle of year-on-year, month-on-month?
* What are the most often produced genres?
* What movies have the highest return-on-investment?
* What movies raked in the most revenue?

### Process Workflow
##### **Planning**
As Benjamin Franklin said,
> "If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail."

Likewise when dealing with databases, it is good practice (an essential, for me), to start off with planning. I did this by doing up an ER-diagram:
