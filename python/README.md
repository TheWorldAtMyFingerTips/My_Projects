has now evolved to encompass business-to-consumer interactions, making the landscape increasingly competitive and thus, imperative to capture customers' attention by having their content as one of the top posts.

This project aims to better understand Instagram's algorithm and, from a user-standpoint - find out which are the "super" variables to focus efforts on in the trajectory to making Instagram top posts.

It is a balanced dataset which contains a total of 2170 entries, with 1099 top posts and 1071 not top posts.

#### Problem Statement
Which variables hold higher weightage in making a post come up on top? This project uses Machine Learning Models of `Logistic Regression` and `Random Forest` in sifting out the "super" variables.


#### Results
Based on the F1 Score for both models, I had decided that `Random Forest` was the best model to
