* Information Functions (e.g. ISERROR, ISERR, ISNUMBER, ISBLANK, ISLOGICAL, etc.)
* Power Query (Extract, transform, load, operations, etc.)
* Creating Interactive Excel Dashboards
* What-if Analysis and Goal Seek

# Capstone Project 1: Build an Excel Interactive Dashboard

### Abstract
Where there is data, there _will be_ Microsoft Excel. The application has been (and still remains) as the perennial go-to-app for almost everyone (personal use, schools, businesses). Excel is a spreadsheet program which is used to create grids of numbers, text, and formulas which perform calculations. In business, it is commonly used to do up budgets, charts, record income and expenditure, and the like.

This project is based off the context that my boss (my target audience) wants a dashboard with key performance indicators to enable an overview of the business, **with** the segregation by region (as each Head of Sales is charge of a region). The dashboard will allow him to dynamically extract the relevant KPIs while speaking to the Heads of Sales to get deeper insights as to why the metrics is so, with the ultimate objective of driving sales growth.


### Dataset Introduction
The [Sample Superstore Dataset](https://www.wisdomaxis.com/technology/software/data/for-reports/super-stores-data-for-reports.php) contains the orders and returns of a retail business in the United States of America. The business has three segments (`Consumer`, `Corporate`, `Home Office`), and sells a wide range of products under the categories of `furniture`, `office supplies`, and `technology`. The dataset contains 9994 rows of data, with columns such as sales, quantity, discount, profit, product_name, product_ID, order_date, and the like.

### Problem Statement
The Dashboard serves to answer questions like:
* Which region is raking in the the highest/lowest revenue?
* Which state(s) are the major sales drivers, or burdens?
* How does the trend of revenue growth look like on a year-on-year, month-to-month perspective?
* Which segment, categories, sub-categories are performing well relatively to their peers?
* Which sub-categories are bringing in the profits/losses?
*
